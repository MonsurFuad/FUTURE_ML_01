# 🧠 Sales Forecasting for Retail Business

This project was completed as part of my Machine Learning Internship at Future Interns (April 2025). The objective was to build a time series forecasting model to predict future retail sales using historical data.

## 📋 Overview

The retail industry depends heavily on forecasting to manage inventory, demand planning, and strategic decisions. In this project, I used Python and Facebook Prophet to forecast sales trends and patterns based on transaction data.

## 🎯 Goals
- Preprocess and clean sales data
- Visualize historical monthly sales trends
- Forecast future sales using Facebook Prophet
- Evaluate model performance using MAE, RMSE, MAPE
- Share insights through visualizations

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
- Facebook Prophet – Time series forecasting
- Scikit-learn – Evaluation metrics
